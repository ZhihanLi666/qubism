Welcome to the linux C++ Qubism code, version 0.99!

In order to build the executable file "xqview", you must have
installed blas, lapack, xlib and imlib2, with the corresponding header
files. In, e.g., Debian/Ubuntu, try the following command line in
order to ensure you have everything:

>> sudo apt-get install g++ libx11-dev libblas-dev libblas3gf liblapack-dev
liblapack3gf libimlib2-dev libimlib2

Now, build the executable:

>> make xqview

If you were successful, try

>> xqview wf/H.012.001 white

A nice qubistic picture should appear in your display. You can quit
pressing "z". Inside the viewer you can use the keys 1, 2, 3 and 4 in
order to zoom on one of the quadrants, or 0 to zoom out.

Unfortunately, the code is not properly documented yet. We are working
on that. All questions, suggestions, remarks... are welcome. Contact
us at jvrlag@gmail.com (Javier Rodriguez-Laguna) or pmigdal@gmail.com

Enjoy!
